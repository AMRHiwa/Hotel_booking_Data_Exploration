# Hotel booking Data Exploration

In this file we have tried to read the hotel_booking.csv file and extract its data.


<h2 id="about_ds">About Dataset</h2>

Since the original dataset was a real hotel dataset, of real customers, all the elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted.

All the values of the columns: 'name', 'email', 'phone number' and 'credit_card' have been artificially created using a python and filled into the dataset.
